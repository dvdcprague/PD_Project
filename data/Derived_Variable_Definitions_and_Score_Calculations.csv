"Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dose","Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dose (LEDD)","The variable LEDD shows the Levodopa equivalent daily dose for each individual PD medication. To find the total LEDD at a specific time point, add all values of the variable LEDD for each PD medication being taken at that time point. Anticholinergics and other medications that are not included in the calculation of the total LEDD will have a missing value for the variable LEDD.  For COMT inhibitors, the variable LEDD will read ""LD x 0.5"" or ""LD x 0.33"". To find the LEDD for COMT inhibitors, first find the total dose of Levodopa only, and then multiply that value by either 0.5 or 0.33 as instructed.  Note: The variable LEDD is only updated quarterly, so this variable will not necessarily be up-to-date with the other data in the CONMED data file.","CONMED","2016-09-12 14:14:25.0"
